# 🏁 Ideal Lap Time Calculator

Simulate and calculate the **ideal lap time** for any Formula 1 track by analyzing corner speeds, straight-line acceleration, DRS zones, ERS usage, tyre wear, and more.

Built by Invis55 💻  
Made for F1 fans, engineers-in-the-making, or just data nerds who like shaving milliseconds 🧠

## 📦 Features

- 📐 Corner and straight-line simulation based on real physics
- ⚡ ERS deployment + DRS boost handling
- ☁️ Weather, tyre wear, and fuel effect simulation
- 🔄 Modular section system (straights, corners, chicanes, etc.)
- 🔍 Track data customizable per sector and segment

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The script breaks a track into sections:
- **Straight** – acceleration based on top speed and DRS/ERS boosts
- **Corner** – calculates time using radius + ideal apex speed
- Each section’s time is added to form the final lap time.

It factors in:
- Downforce and drag
- ERS (battery deployment)
- Tyre degradation
- Weather (coming soon™)
